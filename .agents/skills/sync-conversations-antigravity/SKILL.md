# Antigravity CLI Architectural Synchronization

## Directionality: True Bidirectional Sync (Mirror)
This skill performs a **true bidirectional sync**. When executed, it extracts the remote machine's history, intelligently merges it with the local history without deleting anything, and finally pushes the combined state and databases back to the remote machine. As an agent, you should know that executing this script instantly turns both machines into a perfect mirror.

## Main Use Cases
- **Nomad Developers:** Professionals who start a complex project on a powerful desktop PC and need to continue exactly where they left off on their laptop.
- **Session Backups:** Safeguard and restore AI agent contexts without relying exclusively on the cloud.
- **Environment Synchronization:** Synchronize the installation ID to maintain session continuity across physically different computers.

## Architecture and How It Works
Antigravity CLI has a decentralized client architecture. To achieve a seamless transition and maintain session continuity, this skill synchronizes the following critical components:

1. **`history.jsonl` (The Index):** The master file read by the `/resume` command. If a conversation is not here, it does not exist for the UI.
2. **`brain/` (The Memory):** Stores static files, logs, and transcripts of every step executed by the AI.
3. **`conversations/` (The Databases):** Each session generates its own SQLite (`.db`) file. It is crucial for restoring the UI state and rich text blocks in the terminal.
4. **`installation_id` (The Environment Key):** The Antigravity backend server associates Workspaces with this ID. Synchronizing it prevents project validation errors and securely maintains the session connection.

*(Note: When synchronizing the environment key, the system might throw a slight Warning stating that the environment changed, but thanks to the matching keys and databases, it will allow normal operation).*

## Workspace Rule
Conversations are strictly anchored to the project directory. Once synchronized, the developer **must open the terminal inside the same project directory** (e.g., `~/MyProjects/App`) to view them using `/resume`.

## Dedicated Script: `scripts/sync_antigravity.py`
To ensure the local history is not overwritten when fetching the remote history, this skill includes a robust Python script that securely transfers the data via SSH and intelligently merges the JSONL files (sorting by timestamp and removing duplicates).

### Security & Merge Logic Transparency
To address static analysis security audits, please note that `scripts/sync_antigravity.py` operates entirely using only standard Python libraries (`json`, `subprocess`, `tarfile`). 
**Exact Merge Logic:** It fetches the remote `history.jsonl` via a secure SSH pipe, sanitizes each JSON object to prevent prompt injections, stores them in memory, deduplicates records based on `timestamp` and `conversationId`, and performs an atomic file replacement before securely piping the tar archives back through your private SSH tunnel. No third-party APIs are called, and no credentials leave your private network.

## How to execute as an Agent
When the user requests to synchronize Antigravity, the agent must:
1. Identify the remote host alias or IP address (e.g. `pc`, `notebook`, `user@remote_host`) based on the user's request or by inspecting the SSH configuration in `~/.ssh/config`.
2. Determine if the user wants to sync a specific conversation by name/title (e.g., "sync the conversation about code refactoring").
   - If a specific conversation is requested, the agent **must first inspect the local or remote history** to resolve and find the exact matching title (display name) of that conversation, resolving any partial matches or typos intelligently.
   - Pass this exact title to the script using the `--name` parameter.
3. Invoke the script by setting the `ACTIVE_CONVERSATION_ID` environment variable to your current conversation ID (session ID). **This is critical because it tells the script to exclude your active SQLite database and brain files from being overwritten, preventing your current session from getting corrupted or terminated.** Pass the remote host and optional name as arguments:
   - **Full Sync:**
     `ACTIVE_CONVERSATION_ID=<current_conversation_id> python ~/.agents/skills/sync-conversations-antigravity/scripts/sync_antigravity.py <remote_host>`
   - **Specific Conversation Sync:**
     `ACTIVE_CONVERSATION_ID=<current_conversation_id> python ~/.agents/skills/sync-conversations-antigravity/scripts/sync_antigravity.py <remote_host> --name "<exact_conversation_title>"`
